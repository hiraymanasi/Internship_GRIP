#Task 2
In this repository I have done Simple linear regression with two variables.
This regression task is to predict the percentage of
marks that a student is expected to score based upon the
number of hours they studied.
Task 4
Here, I created the Decision Tree classifier for the Iris dataset and visualized it graphically. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
